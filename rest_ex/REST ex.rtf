Django Rest Framework (DRF) does not automatically create files like serializers.py or any other specific code or files in your project. The installation process simply adds the DRF package to your Python environment and makes it available for import in your Django project.

What You Need to Do Manually
After installing DRF, you'll need to create the necessary files and structure yourself. Here are the common steps to set up DRF in your project:

Create Serializers:
You will need to create a serializers.py file in your Django app directory where you define your serializers.
Example:
# todo_api/serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Todo

class TodoSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Todo
        fields = ['id', 'task', 'completed', 'timestamp', 'updated', 'user']

Create Views:
Create or modify your views.py file to include API views using DRF.

Update URLs:
Set up the URL routing in your urls.py files for your app and project.

Configure Settings:
Add 'rest_framework' to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py if you haven't done so.

Testing:
You may want to set up tests for your API endpoints using DRF's testing tools.

Summary
While DRF provides many useful features and tools for building APIs, it requires you to manually define serializers, views, and URLs as per your application's needs. The framework facilitates API development but does not automate file or code generation.


To access the CRUD functions through the REST API, open a new tab in your Ib browser and navigate to http://<ip>:8000/<model>/. This will display a list of entries in the model. Access specific entries with http://<ip>:8000/<model>/<id>
