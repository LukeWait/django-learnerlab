"""admin.py

This file configures the Django admin interface for your application. It registers models (database tables) with the admin panel, 
allowing you to manage them easily. By registering your models, you enable the admin interface to provide functionality for 
creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.

When using Django's built-in User and Group models, these models are automatically available in the admin panel. 
If you are using custom user or group models, you will need to register those as well to manage them through the admin interface.
"""

# Import the 'admin' module to register models for the Django admin interface.
from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here - this project doesn't use models or the admin portal, so this file can be ignored in this setup.
